										Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Srivally Chilukuri, a seasoned professional adept at navigating the intersections of software quality assurance and data analysis. My journey encompasses a robust background in software QA engineering, where I've fine-tuned my skills in ensuring the reliability and functionality of software products through rigorous testing methodologies. Concurrently, my expertise extends to the realm of data analysis, where I harness analytical prowess to derive actionable insights from complex datasets, driving strategic decision-making and initiatives.
<br />

My academic voyage includes a Master's in Computer Science from Oregon State University, complemented by a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from Gurunanak Institute of Technology. Throughout my academic and professional endeavors, I've cultivated proficiency in an array of methodologies, languages, frameworks, and tools, spanning from Java and Python to Tableau and SQL.

<br />

In roles such as Graduate Student Analyst at Oregon State University and QA Engineer at Transporeon, I've played pivotal roles in enhancing data accessibility, efficiency, and software reliability. From developing Python scripts to extract data from Tableau workbooks to advocating for release practices and improving processes, my journey is characterized by a commitment to excellence and innovation.
<br />


Moreover, my project portfolio reflects a diverse spectrum of endeavors, from optimizing university student databases to developing innovative applications like Speedscore for speedgolf enthusiasts and logistics-based web scraping solutions.
<br />

In essence, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise, analytical acumen, and a passion for innovation to every endeavor, driving tangible outcomes and elevating organizational success.
